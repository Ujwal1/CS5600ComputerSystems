My name is Ujwal Gupta.
I am having a fun time playing with C. Life is crazy these days. I am living the dream.
I can't tell if its a weekday or a weekend. Is this any good? Who cases! 
Today was a warm day, warmer than past week. I took a walk.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. How vexingly quick daft zebras jump! The five boxing wizards jump quickly. Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. How vexingly quick daft zebras jump! The five boxing wizards jump quickly. Sympathizing would fix Quaker objectives. Jaded zombies acted quaintly but kept driving their oxen forward. Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz. Just keep examining every low bid quoted for soap. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. How vexing to pack flat weapons on poor Jove's foot! Jack quietly moved up front and seized the big ball of wax. Five-quart jugs of liquor make the party livelier. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. Waxy and quivering, jocks fumble the pizza. Big July earthquakes confound zenith dab sequoias. Quick, Brutus, get us plenty of garbage bags! Two dozen liquors flow over my big gloves each night. No job is too big; no fee is too big!Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim.
